"I created a console application that can be used to send remote control commands to Samsung TVs that are using the new encrypted communication protocol. Model 2014+ Samsung TVs. Run the executable to setup the pairing connection and follow the instructions. Once the pairing is complete the program can be executed with a command argument to send one of the available commands to the TV. I have tested on two different H Series TVs successfully. Let me know if you have any issues. I hope it proves useful for others."
